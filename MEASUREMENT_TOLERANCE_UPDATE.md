# Measurement Tolerance & Real-time 2D Diagram Update

## Summary of Changes

This update implements two key features:

1. **Real-time 2D diagram updates** - The diagram now recalculates immediately when measurements are entered
2. **Measurement tolerance** - The system now accounts for real-world measurement inaccuracies (±5%)

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Point Position Calculation (`src/lib/calculations.ts`)

#### Trilateration Algorithm

Replaced the simple point placement with a sophisticated trilateration algorithm that:

- Places the first point at the origin (0, 0)
- Places the second point on the x-axis using the measurement between them
- Calculates remaining points using the intersection of circles (trilateration)
- Validates positions using a third reference point when available

#### Measurement Tolerance

- **Tolerance Level**: 5% (exported as `MEASUREMENT_TOLERANCE`)
- Accounts for real-world measurement inaccuracies when using rulers, tape measures, etc.
- Allows measurements that are slightly off to still create valid shapes

#### Error Detection

The system now detects and reports:

- Missing measurements needed to compute point positions
- Inconsistent measurements that exceed the tolerance threshold
- Which specific measurements are causing problems

### 2. Improved Validation (`src/lib/calculations.ts`)

The `calculateGardenMetrics` function now:

- Validates all measurements against computed positions
- Reports which measurements are inconsistent and by how much
- Shows helpful error messages like:
  - "Unable to compute all point positions. Add more measurements between points."
  - "Measurements inconsistent (5% tolerance): A-B: 2.5m off, B-C: 1.8m off"

### 3. Real-time Updates

The 2D diagram already had real-time update capability built-in through React's `useMemo` hook:

```tsx
const { computedPoints, bounds, scale } = useMemo(() => {
  // ... calculation
}, [points, measurements]);
```

This means:

- ✅ The diagram updates immediately when a new measurement is added
- ✅ The diagram recalculates when measurements are edited
- ✅ No need to press a "Calculate" button

### 4. User Interface Updates (`src/components/display/ResultsDisplay.tsx`)

Added a tolerance information panel that shows:

- The current measurement tolerance (±5%)
- Explanation that the system accounts for real-world inaccuracies

## How It Works

### Example: Creating a Triangle

1. **Add Points**: A, B, C
2. **Add Measurements**:

   - A to B: 10m
   - B to C: 8m
   - C to A: 12m (even if slightly off due to measuring with a ruler)

3. **Calculation Process**:

   - Places A at (0, 0)
   - Places B at (10, 0) using the A-B measurement
   - Calculates C using trilateration:
     - C must be 12m from A
     - C must be 8m from B
     - Finds the intersection point
   - Validates the result against all three measurements with 5% tolerance

4. **Visual Update**:
   - The 2D diagram updates immediately showing the triangle
   - Results display shows area and perimeter
   - Status indicator shows if measurements are valid or inconsistent

## Tolerance Examples

With 5% tolerance:

- A 10m measurement can be anywhere from 9.5m to 10.5m
- A 20m measurement can be anywhere from 19m to 21m
- Measurements outside this range will be flagged as inconsistent

## Testing the Changes

To test the new features:

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

2. Add 3 points (A, B, C)

3. Add measurements between them:

   - Add A-B distance
   - Watch the diagram update immediately
   - Add B-C distance
   - Watch the diagram update again
   - Add C-A distance
   - See the complete validated shape

4. Try intentionally inconsistent measurements:
   - For a triangle, if A-B is 10m and B-C is 5m, C-A cannot be 1m
   - The system will show an error indicating the inconsistency

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Make tolerance configurable by the user
- Show visual indicators on the diagram for inconsistent measurements
- Suggest corrections for inconsistent measurements
- Add angle calculations and validation
- Support for more complex shapes with over-constrained measurements

## Technical Details

### Trilateration Math

For finding point C given:

- Point A at position (xa, ya) with distance da to C
- Point B at position (xb, yb) with distance db to C

The algorithm:

1. Calculates the distance between A and B
2. Finds the intersection point(s) of two circles
3. Chooses the point that maintains counter-clockwise orientation
4. Validates against additional measurements if available

### Performance

- All calculations are memoized using React's `useMemo`
- Only recalculates when points or measurements change
- Efficient O(n²) algorithm where n is the number of points
- Maximum iterations cap prevents infinite loops
