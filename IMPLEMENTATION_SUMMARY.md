## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Components

**Forms (Input)**

- `GardenDimensionsForm.tsx` - Garden size and unit configuration
- `MeasurementPointForm.tsx` - Add GPS-based measurement points
- `ShapeForm.tsx` - Create shapes and manage sections

**Display (Output)**

- `GardenMap.tsx` - Interactive Leaflet map with shapes/points
- `CalculationResults.tsx` - Area, perimeter, angles display
- `MeasurementPointsList.tsx` - List of all points with delete option
- `SectionsList.tsx` - Sections with shapes, visibility toggles
- `GardenSuggestions.tsx` - AI-powered layout recommendations

**Core Library**

- `store.ts` - Zustand state management with localStorage persistence
- `calculations.ts` - All garden calculations (area, perimeter, angles, suggestions)
- `validation.ts` - Input validation utilities
- `types/garden.ts` - TypeScript type definitions

### State Management

**Zustand Store includes:**

- Garden dimensions (length, width, unit)
- Measurement points (GPS coordinates, labels, notes)
- Sections (name, shapes, visibility)
- Shapes (type, object type, points, radius, visibility)
- Calculation results (area, perimeter, angles)
- Distance between points & number of points

**Persistence:**

- All state automatically saved to localStorage
- Survives page refreshes and browser restarts

### Calculation Engine

**Distance Calculation**

- Haversine formula for GPS coordinate distances
- Accurate for Earth's curvature
- Returns distances in meters

**Area Calculation**

- Shoelace formula for polygon areas
- Handles rectangles, triangles, custom polygons
- Circle areas using Ï€rÂ²

**Angle Calculation**

- Interior angles at measurement points
- Displayed in degrees
- Useful for planning irrigation and pathways

**Layout Suggestions**

- Analyzes garden configuration
- Provides best practice recommendations
- Considers object types (vegetables, flowers, trees)
- Suggests improvements based on size and layout

## Deployment Options

### Development

```bash
yarn dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
Docker
docker-compose up -d
# Builds and runs containerized version

```
